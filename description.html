      <h2>Oberwallstraße 14 · 10117 Berlin</h2>
      <p><strong>Sale of two units or the entire building –</strong></p>
      <hr>

      <p>Oberwallstraße 14 is a unique architectural townhouse completed in 2009 as part of the “Townhouses Friedrichswerder” project in the historical center of Berlin. Designed and built by Prof. Hans Kollhoff, it combines exclusivity, classical bourgeois elegance, and modern comfort.</p>

      <p>The representative face of the building is formed by a 4.80 m-high and 5.80 m-deep entrance hall with natural-stone columns, two elegant staircases, and a large oriel window facing the street, which also provides access to the underground garage.</p>

      <p>The property comprises a high-end office floor on the raised ground floor with a small garden, as well as two separate (but easily connectable) residential units on the 1st and 2nd floors, and on the 3rd and 4th floors.</p>

      <p>The office unit (raised ground floor, approx. 109 m²) encompasses a stylish reception area, two quiet offices with garden access, and a ventilated conference room. The space features custom oak paneling, an oak library, matching furniture, two to three secretary desks, an archive, safe, kitchenette, and separate sanitary facilities. It can easily be converted into a residential unit.</p>

      <p>The main living floor of Residential Unit 1 (1st + 2nd floors, approx. 226 m²) on the 1st floor is characterized by an open living area of 85 m² with 3.6 m ceiling height. Thanks to its east-west orientation, a patio with granite flooring (convertible into a winter garden), and floor-to-ceiling bay windows facing Oberwallstraße, it offers bright, sun-filled rooms. It includes a fully functional marble fireplace and marble bathroom, as well as a music room, a spacious bedroom, and a sculptural internal staircase leading to the 2nd floor.</p>

      <p>The main living floor of Residential Unit 2 (3rd and 4th floors, approx. 183 m²) comprises a 70 m² open living area with ceiling heights from 3.6 m to 4.7 m, also east-west oriented and light-flooded. It includes a marble fireplace and a west-facing terrace frequently used in summer, as well as a roof terrace of over 50 m² for weekends. Building rights exist for an additional setback floor of approx. 36 m² (e.g., bedroom and small bath) on this roof terrace.</p>

      <p>Each residential unit has an additional private floor (2nd and 3rd floors respectively), accessible via internal stairs. Currently arranged for family living with three bedrooms, a bathroom, and a guest WC. Non-load-bearing partitions allow easy reconfiguration —for example, creation of a 30 m² master bedroom and of a bath of 30 m² plus a 20 m² dressing room.</p>

      <p>A paneled elevator with oak and brass connects all main floors with the underground garage. The garage offers four independently accessible parking spaces on a turntable system (plus one additional position on the turntable itself), as well as two storage rooms, technical and waste rooms.</p>

      <h3>Architect</h3>
      <p>Prof. Hans Kollhoff is one of the leading architects of Berlin’s post-reunification era, known for the Potsdamer Platz towers and the Walter Benjamin Platz ensemble in Charlottenburg. His work is characterized by exceptional architectural ambition. See <a href="https://www.kollhoff.de" target="_blank">www.kollhoff.de</a>.</p>

      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>The building stands on the former Reichsbank site. Oberwallstraße is a quiet side street off the world-famous Unter den Linden, traffic-calmed, one-way, and bicycle-friendly (yet accessible by car for residents). The nearby Hausvogteiplatz (50 m) was once the center of the Weimar Republic fashion industry. The Gendarmenmarkt, Schauspielhaus, Staatsoper, Komische Oper, Pierre Boulez Saal, Friedrichstraße, and many of Berlin’s best restaurants are all within a five-minute walk. Government ministries, embassies, and international hotels are close by. The area is lively on weekdays with professionals, civil servants, diplomats, and students — yet pleasantly quiet on weekends, and highly secure.</p>
